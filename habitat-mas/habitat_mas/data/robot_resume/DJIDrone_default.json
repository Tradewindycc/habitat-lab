    "summary": "The DJI M100 appears to be a drone, indicated by its lack of traditional wheeled or legged base links and its typical usage in aerial applications. This drone base implies it is capable of air mobility, making it suitable for tasks that require movement across different floors by flying."
  },
  "perception": {
    "summary": "The robot is equipped with several sensors critical for perception. It includes a Velodyne sensor, likely a LIDAR, mounted on the 'veloydyne_base_link'. Additionally, it has a RealSense camera linked to the 'realsense_camera' and 'realsense_depth_optical_frame', providing depth and visual information. It also includes a generic 'head_camera', though specific details about its capabilities are not provided. These sensors collectively allow the robot to perceive its environment, generate geometric information, and assist in object manipulation tasks.",

  "manipulation": {
    "summary": "The URDF structure doesn't specify any dedicated end effectors or manipulative joints. Therefore, it appears this model of the DJI M100 may lack direct manipulation capabilities. The robot might rely on carrying an attached payload or collaborating with other robots for manipulation tasks.",
