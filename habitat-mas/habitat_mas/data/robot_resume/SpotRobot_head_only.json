    "summary": "The robot, Spot, has a quadruped base with four legs (fl, fr, hl, hr - representing front left, front right, hind left, and hind right respectively) each having three revolute joints (hip, uleg, lleg). This design allows it to move effectively across various terrains, providing stability and agility for cross-floor navigation, which is crucial for tasks involving cross-floor object rearrangement."
  },
  "perception": {
    "summary": "Spot is equipped with a head-mounted camera (head_camera) on a fixed joint, which provides it with a stable and consistent view for capturing visual data. This setup is essential for tasks requiring geometric information for objects, allowing it to identify and locate objects in the environment, which supports cooperative perception for manipulation.",

    "summary": "Spot has an extendable arm (arm0) consisting of multiple revolute joints (sh0, sh1, hr0, el0, el1, wr0, wr1) ending in a finger-like end effector (arm0.link_fngr). This arm structure provides a high degree of dexterity and range of motion necessary for manipulating objects, including picking and placing objects from one floor to another, and rearranging objects even in abnormal positions like on high shelves or under tables.",
