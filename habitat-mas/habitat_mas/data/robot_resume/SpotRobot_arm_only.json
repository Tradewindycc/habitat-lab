    "summary": "The robot, named Spot, is designed for ground mobility. It features a quadrupedal base with four legs, each equipped with three revolute joints (hip, upper leg, and lower leg), allowing for adaptive and versatile movement across various terrains, including the ability to traverse stairs or uneven surfaces."
  },
  "perception": {
    "summary": "The robot has sensors for perception, as indicated by the articulated_agent_arm_camera located on the end effector of its arm. This positioning suggests the robot is capable of obtaining detailed geometric information about objects it manipulates, essential for tasks such as searching, identifying, and gathering precise measurements for manipulation.",

  "manipulation": {
    "summary": "Spot is equipped with a sophisticated manipulatory arm. This arm consists of multiple revolute joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers), providing considerable dexterity. The manipulator is capable of complex tasks such as picking and placing objects, rearranging furniture, and reaching challenging positions (e.g., high shelves and under tables). The end effector can fine-tune its grip for precise object manipulation, supported by the integrated camera for detailed observation.",
