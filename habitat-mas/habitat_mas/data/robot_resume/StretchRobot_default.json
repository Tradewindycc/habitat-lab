  "perception": {
    "summary": "The robot is equipped with an extensive array of sensors, particularly a camera system mounted on a head with pan and tilt capabilities for wide-angle vision. The camera setup includes depth, infrared, color, accelerometer, and gyroscope frames, providing comprehensive 3D and motion sensing. This suite of sensors supports the robot in accurately searching, perceiving objects, and obtaining geometric information necessary for manipulation.",

  "manipulation": {
    "summary": "The robot features a sophisticated arm with multiple prismatic joints allowing linear extension and retraction and three revolute joints at the wrist (yaw, pitch, roll) providing rotational movements. The end effector is a multi-fingered gripper capable of grasping diverse objects. This versatile arm and gripper combination enables effective manipulation tasks, such as picking and placing objects from high shelves or under tables.",
