    "summary": "The robot 'Spot' features a quadrupedal base with four legs, each having three revolute joints (hip, upper leg, lower leg). This configuration provides high mobility over various terrains and allows it to walk, climb stairs, and potentially hop over obstacles, making it capable of navigating multi-floor environments."
  },
  "perception": {
    "summary": "The robot is equipped with two cameras: one is a fixed joint-connected head camera on the base, and the other is a fixed joint-connected articulated agent arm camera. The head camera likely provides a wide field of view from a fixed height, assisting in overall navigation and environment perception. The arm camera, positioned on the end effector, provides detailed views of objects during manipulation tasks.",

  "manipulation": {
    "summary": "Spot has a versatile manipulator arm with seven revolute joints and an end effector designed for grasping (finger). The extensive joint configuration allows for a significant range of motion, including high shelves and under tables. The fixed camera on the arm aids in precise object manipulation by providing detailed visual feedback. This configuration is suitable for complex tasks such as object rearrangement and cooperative perception-based manipulation.",
