    "summary": "The robot, named Fetch, has a wheeled base with two continuous joints for each wheel (left and right), allowing it to navigate on the ground with differential drive. This base type supports movements essential for cross-floor object rearrangement and home arrangement tasks."
  },
  "perception": {
    "summary": "Fetch is equipped with a head-mounted camera system comprised of both RGB and depth cameras, positioned on a chain of revolving joints (head_pan_link and head_tilt_link) allowing the cameras to pan and tilt, thereby offering a comprehensive field of view. Specifically, it has an RGB camera and a depth camera, both of which have fixed links to their respective optical frames. Additionally, there appears to be an articulated agent arm camera fixed to the gripper link, enhancing its capability to perceive objects directly within the manipulation range.",

  "manipulation": {
    "summary": "Fetch features a highly articulated 7-DOF arm beginning with a prismatic torso for lift capability, followed by consecutive revolute and continuous joints, culminating in a gripper with prismatic joints for finger movement. This structure allows Fetch to manipulate objects effectively, making it suitable for pick-and-place tasks and rearranging furniture, including accessing objects on high shelves and under tables.",
